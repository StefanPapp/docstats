# purpose
This is a simple python program to
* parse a directory and its subdirectory for docx files
* and aggregate for each docx statistics

I used it to estimate how much pages I wrote when I was doing
bookwriting.

I might still refine it as I keep writing (more technical than
fictional) for now.
